##### Data Tool

This is a tool provided by the Dutch Institute for Public Health and Environment (RIVM)
to analyze measurement data. This tool is under development and they are asking users
for feedback.

##### Measuring Sound

The Dutch Institute for Public Health and Environment (RIVM) is pushing for DIY sound
measurements (similar to the fine dust sensors). Currently there are several different
designs in the running. Latest developments can be found here:

##### Measuring NO2

This, as of now, is in a very experimental phase. The measurement tools for the outdoor NO2 levels is very unreliable. Mostly due to the very low levels compared to industrial cases. Additionally, the reliability of measurement data is affected by the local O3 levels and temperature.

The RIVM is experimenting with a Calibration workflow in which the measurement device is calibrated against local governmental measurement stations regularly. This, of course, is not ideal.
